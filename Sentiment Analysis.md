# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

A complete NLP pipeline to classify text reviews as **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing and a Naive Bayes classifier.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- CoLab

## 📌 Features
- Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, stemming, stopword removal
- Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for vectorization
- Train/test split
- Naive Bayes model training
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation
- Real-time prediction on single reviews

## 🧪 Process

1. **Text Cleaning** – Removed non-alphabetic characters, converted to lowercase  
2. **Tokenization & Stemming** – Used NLTK’s `PorterStemmer`  
3. **Vectorization** – Created a BoW model using `CountVectorizer`  
4. **Model Training** – Trained a `MultinomialNB` classifier on training data  
5. **Evaluation** – Used a confusion matrix to assess performance  
6. **Single Review Prediction** – Applied the same pipeline to individual reviews

## ✅ Results
- Achieved ~82% accuracy on the test set
- Predicted unseen review sentiments correctly
- Modular design enables reuse on other sentiment tasks
